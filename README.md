**fieldify** is a schema modeler, a data extractor and a generic object iterator. It allows you to read, transform or verify a data schema.

It allows you to read or transform a schema and extract or verify related data. It is very useful for handling complex objects and schemas. Especially when designing CRUD or API input validator.

## Installation

Using NPM :

```sh
npm install fieldify
```

Using Yarn :

```sh
yarn add fieldify
```

## Introduction

There are a few basic points in Fieldify. In particular the management of arrays and the use of **\$** in front of certain fields.

Fieldify is a recursive object iterator which allows :

- Read or transform a schema - **assignator**
- Extract and verify the input data following a schema - **iterator**

It is essential to understand the use of **\$**. When a field in a schema is preceded by **\$** this means that the iterator will not enter processing in this field, this allows options to be given to the parent field and this recursively.

So you can give any options you want to define the properties of a field.

```js
const schema = {
  name: {
    first: {
      $options: "string",
      $max: 30,
      $onCheck: (data, next) => {}
    },
    last: {
      $options: "string"
    }
  }
};
```

### Nested Object and Array

The last important point in Fieldify is the notion of Array and Nested object. The great ability of Fieldify is to support Nested Objects and Array. In a Fieldify schema the definition of an Array makes it possible to define the type of the field. One cannot thus define several element in an array of schema however to define one of them will allow Fieldify to authorize elements in time as source/input in the iterator.

In a schema the **assign** or the **fusion** will only take the first element of an Array to compose the output.

It's a bit complex like that but very useful every day:

```js
// a Fieldify schema
const schema = {
  name: {
    // define an array field
    first: [
      {
        fieldOne: {
          $opt: true
        },
        fieldTwo: {
          $opt: true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
};

// an input
const input = {
  name: {
    first: [
      {
        fieldOne: 32,
        fieldTwo: 43
      },
      {
        fieldOne: 1,
        fieldTwo: 4
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

## Schema Assignation

The assigner allows you to extract fields (those that are not prefixed with **\$**) from a schema in a desired format. This is particularly useful for transforming a Fieldify schema into another schema format.

Example: Transforming a Fieldify schema into a Mongo (mongoose) schema

Info: The assigner works in blocking mode. It is not recommended to let users control the schema without validation.

Below is an example of a Fieldify schema

```js
const schema = {
  entry: {
    $read: false,

    subEntry1: {
      $read: true
    },

    subEntry2: {
      $read: true,

      subEntry22: {
        $read: true
      }
    }
  }
};
```

In the example below we transform an assigner into another format. Even if **\$read** is **false** we continue to follow the tree.

```js
const extract = fieldify.assign(schema, (user, dst, object, source) => {
  dst["_read"] = object.$read;
});

/* Will return

{
	"entry": {
		"_read": false,
		"subEntry1": {
			"_read": true
		},
		"subEntry2": {
			"_read": true,
			"subEntry22": {
				"_read": true
			}
		}
	}
}
*/
```

Extract a schema and prohibit the iterator from going further in its floor if **\$read** is **false**. This is **return(false)** which indicates the iterator to return to a lower floor.

```js
const extract = fieldify.assign(schema, (user, dst, object, source) => {
  dst["_read"] = object.$read;

  // do not follow the rest in any case
  if (object.$read === false) return false;
});

/* Will return

{
	"entry": {
		"_read": false
	}
}
*/
```

There is an example that shows how to merge 2 fields into one in examples/assignator-rw.js.

## Input Iterator

Once the schema is defined and modeled it is necessary to compile it in order to optimize the traversing of the tree.

```js
const fieldify = require("fieldify");
const crypto = require("crypto");

const schema = {
  $write: false,

  name: {
    $read: false,
    $write: true,

    first: { $read: true },
    last: { $read: true }
  },
  password: {
    $write: true
  }
};
const handler = fieldify.compile(schema);
```

The **handler** corresponds to the compiled instance of the schema which will be used later for the iteration.

The iterator is a means of extracting data from an entry according to the defined Fieldify scheme. This is very useful for validating or verifying input data.

This is how things start to get interesting, in the example below we are going to check some input data and assignment.

Considering the following entry:

```js
const input = {
  name: {
    first: "Michael",
    last: "Vergoz"
  },
  password: "My super password"
};
```

We will create 2 assignators, one to extract the data that is readable and the other for the data that can be written. Thus the **password** field cannot be read.

```js
function isReadable(current, next) {
  if (current.access.$read === true) {
    current.result[current.key] = current.input;
  }
  next();
}

function isWritable(current, next) {
  if (current.access.$write === true) {
    current.result[current.key] = current.input;
  }
  next();
}
```

It is important to note that the extraction functions are asynchronous and so the **next()** callback must be executed on each pass. It is thus possible to question a third party service for a field without blocking the iteration.

```js
const opts = {
  handler: handler,
  input: input,
  onAssign: isReadable,
  onEnd: iterator => {
    console.log(iterator.result);
  }
};
fieldify.iterator(opts);
```

In the example above, we retrieve the input data according to the Fieldify schema compiled handler with the **onAssign()** assignment function which will extract only the fields inheriting from a **\$read** flag to **true**. In this example, the password field will not be rendered when the iteration has finished and executed the **onEnd()** callback

This type of iteration is very useful when presenting data to the user (database > user)

```js
const opts = {
  handler: handler,
  input: input,
  onAssign: isWritable,
  onEnd: iterator => {
    console.log(iterator.result);
  }
};
fieldify.iterator(opts);
```

In the example above the password field will be returned in the result. This case arises when we want to insert the data in a database (user > database)
